# GitHub Actions

Pin every action to a full commit SHA with the version in a trailing comment:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@<full-sha>  # vX.Y.Z
  with:
    persist-credentials: false
```

Look up the current stable version and its SHA — never carry either from memory.

## Before committing

```bash
actionlint .github/workflows/    # syntax and expression errors
zizmor .github/workflows/        # security audit
```

## Hardening

- Set `permissions:` explicitly at the workflow or job level; default to `contents: read`
- `persist-credentials: false` on `actions/checkout` unless the job genuinely needs to push
- Never interpolate untrusted input (`github.event.issue.title`, branch names, PR bodies) directly into a `run:` block — pass it through `env:` and reference the variable
- Prefer `pull_request` over `pull_request_target`; the latter runs with access to secrets and a read/write `GITHUB_TOKEN`

## Dependabot

Configure 7-day cooldowns and grouped updates. Use the `uv` ecosystem (not `pip`) for Python projects so `uv.lock` gets updated.
